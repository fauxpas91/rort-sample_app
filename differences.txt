1) Chapter 3
TASK:
You may have noticed some repetition in the Static Pages controller test (Listing 3.24). In particular, the base title, “Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App”,
is the same for every title test. Using the special function setup, which is automatically run before every test, verify that the tests in Listing 3.30 are still GREEN.
(Listing 3.30 uses an instance variable, seen briefly in Section 2.2.2 and covered further in Section 4.4.5, combined with string interpolation, which is covered further in Section 4.2.2.)

ACTION:
Added 'Def setup' to 'static_pages_controller_test' which creates the instance variable '@base_title'

2) Chapter 3
TASK:
1. Make a Contact page for the sample app.16 Following the model in Listing 3.15, first write a test for the existence of a page at the URL /static_pages/contact by testing for the title
“Contact | Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App”. Get your test to pass by following the same steps as when making the About page in Section 3.3.3, including filling the Contact page with the content from Listing 3.40.

ACTION:
Added a new test called 'shoud get contact' to the 'static_pages_controller_test'. Added a new GET route to 'routes.rb' for the contact page. Added a new action in 'static_pages_controller'.
Added a new page called 'contact.html.erb'.
